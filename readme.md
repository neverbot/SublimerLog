}

## What Gets Logged

- Plugin initialization and loading order
- File operations (new, open, save, close)
- System information (ST version, platform, Python version)
- Sublime Text startup time
- Module loading information

## Technical Details

### Loading Order

The plugin uses the filename `000_sublimer_log.py` to ensure it loads first, as Sublime Text loads plugins alphabetically.

### Event Monitoring

The plugin extends `sublime_plugin.EventListener` to monitor various Sublime Text events:

- `on_init()` - When ST finishes loading
- `on_new()` - New file created
- `on_load()` - File loaded
- `on_pre_save()` / `on_post_save()` - File save operations
- `on_close()` - File closed
